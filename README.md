Hello, this is a compilation of all the programming projects I have completed during my time at UCSB. Here is a description of each folder name: 

- CS 8: An Introduction to Computer Science (Winter 2017) 
  - This folder contains all the assignments and projects I have completed for my first computer science course at UCSB. 
  - In this course, I learned about Python Syntax, Objects and Classes, Strings and Console Output, Conditionals and Control Flow, File Input/Output, Character Encodings, Containers and Randomness, and the Web and Search. 

- MATH 104A: Introduction to Numerical Analysis (Fall 2019) 
  - This folder contains all the programming assignments I have completed. I used Jupyter Notebook to record and display my solutions in either Markdown/LaTeX or Python to each homework question. In each assignment, you'll see how I wrote short Python codes to efficiently derive strenuous numerical computations. 
  - The topics I learned in this course were Mathematical Preliminaries and Error Analysis, Solutions of Equations in One Variable, and Interpolation and Polynomial Approximation. 

- MATH 104B: Numerical Analysis (Winter 2020) 
  - Same description as MATH 104A's folder description. 
  - The topics I learned for this course were Numerical Differentiation and Integration, Initial-Value Problems for Ordinary Differential Equations, Direct Methods for Solving Linear Systems, and Iterative Techniques in Matrix Algebra. 

- PSTAT 122: Design and Analysis of Experiments (Spring 2020) 
  - This folder contains all the assignments I have completed. These assignments demonstrate my data visualization, statistical programming, hypothesis testing, and data/statistical analysis skills in R. I used RStudio and Markdown/LaTeX to produce my reports. 
  - The topics I learned in this course were Principles of Randomization, Blocking and Replication; Fixed, Random and Mixed Effect Models; Block Designs, Factorial Designs and Nested Designs; and Analysis of Variance and Multiple Comparison. 

-  PSTAT 126: Regression Analysis (Spring 2019) 
  - This folder contains all the homework assignments I have completed for this course. These assignments demonstrate my data visualization, statistical programming, and data/statistical analysis skills in R. In Homework 6, you'll see my data visualization skills with ggplot2 which is a highly favored R package among data visualization frantics! 
  - The topics I learned in this course were Linear and Multiple Regression, Analysis of Residuals, Variable and Model Selection including Stepwise Regression, and Analysis of Covariance. 

- PSTAT 160A: Applied Stochastic Processes (Fall 2018) 
  - This folder contains all the homework assignments I have completed for this course. These assignments
